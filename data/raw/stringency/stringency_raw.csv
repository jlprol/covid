Surveillance and Laboratory Diagnosis: (1)We began to identify people who developed fever, cough or other acute respiratory symptoms and who had a past 14-day travel history or close  contact with the above mentioned people. They are all required to report to the health authorities and provide a lab specimen for further laboratory diagnosis. (2)When a person seeks medical attention using his or her National Health Insurance (NHI) card, the person’s travel history to areas affected by COVID-19 will display on the system because immigration data is linked to the National Health Insurance Administration. This system helps remind a physician to pay attention to past 14-day travel history and inquire and examine the person accordingly. This can effectively prevent failing to detect a potential case.(3)Since February 16, 2020, we have enhanced COVID-19 case finding by proactively seeking out patients with severe respiratory symptoms who had tested negative for influenza and retested them for COVID-19. In addition, patients who are highly suspected as COVID-19 infection by the physicians as well as medical staff with pneumonia or cluster are also subject to provide specimens for further laboratory diagnosis. (4)In order to have specimens tested quickly, we have improved our laboratory diagnosis capacities from 12 laboratories for 520 cases per day to 34 laboratories for 3,200 cases per day.",0,,0,,,,1,0,11.11,11.11,14.29,14.29

In addition, for the time being, we have started implementing extraordinary measures to deny entry of foreign nationals who have any history of staying in Hubei Province within 14 days and those who possess a Chinese passport issued by Hubei Province, unless there is any specific need. I ask all of you to exert efforts to avoid trouble on the ground, by preventing those to whom those measures apply from boarding aircraft, through collaboration among relevant parties, including airlines. Furthermore, I ask the immigration authority to strictly implement these measures, including identifying individuals to whom those measures apply with a system capable of smoothly and easily making the relevant determination, and to exert efforts to implement it adequately by sufficiently paying attention to individuals’ circumstances.

Since more than 500 schools closed by Feb 6 (an additional 200+ compared to Feb 3), I'm gonna assume that all those schools did not reopen between Feb 09 and the nationwide shutdown (Feb 23), but I cannot prove it due to my nonexistent Korean language skills. I have therefore marked 10/02 until 22/02 as suspect, but I fear that a Korean speaker is needed to fill in that gap.

Iran,IRN,20200220,0,,,0,,,1,0,"The Ministry of Health and Medical Education sent a letter to the governor of Qom, requesting to ""limit the number of pilgrims at the Fatima Masumeh Shrine and other religious sites"". However, Shia shrines in Qom remained open for pilgrims to congregate. https://web.archive.org/web/20200312121420/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/world/middleeast/coronavirus-iran.html",0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,0,,,0,,0,,0,,0,,,0,"All the news reports available in English seem to suggest that testing was very limited and did not follow a clear strategy.

A necessary action to keep the flow of movement limited over a holiday that holds significance in the country. Prior to the ban, traffic into Ulaanbaatar was monitored by stopping cars and requiring that all passengers have their foreheads scanned to detect an abnormal temperature. Something I myself experienced.  But not all public transportation was banned, within the capital the main bus lines were running, but were limited to running on “peak” hours. And even though in the U.S. the CDC advises that wearing a face mask isn’t necessary if you are not sick, they were mandatory while riding public transportation in Ulaanbaatar. http://web.archive.org/web/20200404103344/https://www.forbes.com/sites/breannawilson/2020/03/16/mongolia-announces-3-new-covid-19-cases-totaling-4-how-they-got-coronavirus-precautions-right/",0,,,2,0, roads and other forms of transportation would be suspended or blocked over Tsagaan Sar (February 21-27) across six provinces.

""Hello, I have questions about some of these guidelines. Who is the best person for me to ask? Should I continue to ask you or reach out to someone at MoPH?     My immediate questions are:    1) What is the start date of implementing these guidelines? I noticed that one of the guidelines said it was created on April 4th. Is that true of all of them?   2) When did MoPH started contact tracing? The document says that contact tracing happens for those who test positive or show symptoms upon arriving to mentioned airports and border points. What if someone tests positive in other locations? How is contact tracing done for them?   3) When was the first day that testing became available in Afghanistan? When it did, was it available for everyone? Or was there a criteria for who could get tested? What is the criteria (generally available or available to only those who show symptoms) for testing now?    Can you please respond to each questions? If you don't have answers, please let me know and I will try to reach out to others.     Thanks so much!""    Their response:    ""Each guideline has been developed in different time frames based on need while most of them were developed in February.   The contact tracing started by the first COVID19 confirmed case on 24th February 2020; however, the national and provincial contact tracing teams were established on 27th February. The contact tracing is done for all confirmed cases form all over the country through phone calls. There has been a form, SoP, and guidelines developed for the purpose, I am copying Momena Jan (the national focal point of contact tracing) for more info if needed.   The testing was available in early February and it was based on the case definition of that time (only people coming from China in points of entries having sign and symptoms of the disease were tested) then when Iran was also confirmed as a country with transmission potentials, the passengers from Iran was also screened and if they had sign and symptoms they were also being tested.   I hope it helps.   In case of more information, we would be happy to help.   Regards""",0,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example, the $826 million (should be $836) includes items beyond just vaccines.

A statement issued by MoHAP today said that those who travel may face preventative measures upon their return to the UAE - at the discretion of competent authorities - including undergoing medical checks at the airport, and a 14-day home quarantine. Those who test positive will be transferred to a designated health facility for treatment and quarantine to ensure their safety and to avoid contact with others, the statement added.   http://web.archive.org/web/20200421153546/https://www.ncema.gov.ae/en/media-center/news/5/3/2020/health-ministry-advises-public-not-to-travel-amid-global-coronavirus-outbreak.aspx ",0,,,0,,0,,,,0,,,0,,2,,0,,0,,,,,,18.92,18.92,22.86,22.86

This will provide them an extra 200bn Danish kroner in liquidity, which they can either use to lend to businesses or to withstand losses on existing loans. Two new loan guarantee schemes, one for large companies and one for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The government will guarantee 70 percent of the value of any new bank loans given to SMEs who have seen operating profits fall by more than 50 percent. This could back up to 4.8bn kroner in new loans. It will guarantee 70 percent of the value of new loans to large companies who can demonstrate a fall in turnover over more than 50 percent. This could back 2.7bn kroner in new loans. Employers from now on be completely reimbursed by the government from the first day that an employee becomes ill or enters quarantine due to coronavirus, rather than having to themselves absorb the bill for the few days. Employment legislation is being relaxed to allow companies to reduce employees hours temporarily, with the employees incomes then supplemented by unemployment benefit. The Ministry of Employment hopes that this will prevent employees from being laid off.” (source: https://www.thelocal.dk/20200313/denmark-moves-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-impact) 4.8bn kr + 2.7bn kr = 7.5bn kr, which is $1,112,519,985.92 on 13.03.20 http://web.archive.org/web/20200415142429/https://www.x-rates.com/historical/?from=USD&amount=1&date=2020-03-13",,,2,1,,1,,1,,0,,0,,,,676,0,76.71,76.71,77.62,77.62

Full text below  http://web.archive.org/web/20200408093021/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19#U  The central bank has temporarily reduced the reserve requirements that apply to the nominal peso and the inflation-adjusted peso deposits in the commercial banks. This measure is expected to inject about US$300 million of additional liquidity into the financial system. Loan payments for households and businesses that may be affected by the public health measures are to be deferred for up to 180 days. The fund that guarantees loans for SMEs will be expanded from US$50 million to US$500 million (utilizing financing from international organizations). That will allow to guarantee the SME loans totaling US$2.5 billion. In addition, the rate of commission charged by the fund will be reduced substantially. BROU (the country’s largest commercial bank, which is government-owned) will extend soft loans to enterprises.

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.    The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.    The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.    New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.    Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.    Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.  https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101",3,,0,,,0,,0,,0,,2,1,,3,,1,,0,,0,,,,9415,150,64.44,64.44,68.1,68.1

The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residents to stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15. Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia and Wisconsin made such announcements earlier in the day.      The 15 states where those orders are effective or about to come into effect cover just over 42 per cent of the population in the 50 states and District of Columbia.      The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms.      New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.      Some individual cities and counties have issued stay at home orders, even though the states have not. As such, the proportion of the population affected by those restrictions probably exceeds 42 per cent.      Texas, the US's second most-populous state, does not have a stay at home order in place, but local media reported the capital, Austin, was expected to take this route tomorrow, following in the footsteps of Dallas and Waco.   https://www.ft.com/content/f96ada9f-bd2a-39a7-8b59-c4170f5a1101",3,,2,0,"Unemployment insurance in the U.S. is state-specific, but overseen by the U.S. Dept. of Labor.

The funeral of a person who dies of the coronavirus should be carried out in accordance with special measures, and with a few close relatives. This also comes as at least 500 mosques were closed in Herat late last week in an attempt by the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the province. Sunni mosques largely stayed open until April 5, when the Ulema High Commission established to prevent the spread of COVID-19 issued a fatwa to close the mosques and the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs joined in announcing new restrictions. Prior to the April 5 decision, some mullahs were encouraging people to gather in mosques and pray for a cure. The ministry of public health asked the people to respect the day-time curfew rule and stay in their homes.  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501101104/https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/in-afghanistan-muslim-call-to-prayer-now-carries-stay-at-home-message/30542023.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501102039/https://tolonews.com/health/afghan-clerics-ban-religious-political-gatherings-amid-covid-19  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501102534/http://www.afghanistantimes.af/amid-virus-clerics-issue-fatwa-again-religious-political-gatherings/  https://web.archive.org/web/20200501103414/https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/coronavirus-afghanistan-opportunity-build-trust-taliban  ",2,0,,2,0,,1,0,,1,,,,,,,0,,,,2,1,,1,,1,,0,,0,,,,270,5,72.36,72.36,73.1,73.1

COVID-19 Czar, Richard Carter, says this is because of the limitations on the availability of the items required for testing, including swabs and test kits. He was speaking yesterday on one of the local radio call-in programmes as he responded to a caller who suggested that everyone should be tested. Carter, reflecting on the finite supplies, indicated that they are limiting the testing to ensure that the resources currently at their disposal are used in instances where they are absolutely necessary. 'Mass testing of the whole population is not an option that we can use at this moment and it is perhaps not an indication of where we are in the course of the epidemic,' he stated.""
